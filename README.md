# IBM-Introduction-to-Deep-Learning-Neural-Networks-with-Keras
In this course project, you will build a regression model using the deep learning Keras library, and then you will experiment with increasing the number of training epochs and changing number of hidden layers and you will see how changing these parameters impacts the performance of the model.
